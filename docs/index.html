    <h2>Problem Definition, Background & Motivation and Proposed Solution</h2>
    <h3>
      ● Problem definition: Unrestrained usage of plastics and irresponsible
      disposal, leading to evident climate change.
    </h3>

    <h4>1. How plastic consumption has evolved overtime</h4>
    <p>
      Bakelite was the first plastic to be produced, in 1907, making it the
      hallmark of a global revolution; which has undesirably led to generations
      of environmental pollution. Until the 1950s,
      <b>plastic growth was concealed and unseen</b>
      by the authorities. Over the next 65 years, annual production of plastics
      increased nearly 200 folds to 381 million tonnes in 2015. To elaborate the
      context, this is roughly equivalent to the mass of two-thirds of the world
      population.

    <p>
      The net increment of usage hasn’t been calculated for the year 2020, but
      undoubtedly an <b>exponential rise</b> can be predicted. Disposal and the
      3R method seems to be in the air, but in our opinion;
      <b>plastic landfill is the commonest problem well known,</b>
      but solutions are not yet properly addressed by any responsible authority.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Impact of plastics on the environment and wellbeing</h4>

    <p>
      Plastic usage has been abused and adulterated by mankind, stepping towards
      the highest risks of pollution as briefly stated below;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Chemicals included in plastics are often carcinogenic if accidentally
        ingested by wild animals, fish and there by humans, in accordance with
        food chains.
      </li>
      <li>
        Incineration and production of plastics contribute to the greenhouse
        effect, elevating the temperature and thereby resulting in irreversible
        climate changes.
      </li>
      <li>Disposed debris acts as vectors for contaminants and diseases.</li>
      <li>Mismanaged waste causes floods and landslides.</li>
      <li>
        Permanent damages to food webs, ecosystems and biodiversity, hormonal
        changes in humans and mass scale species loss.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Decomposing plastics</h4>
    <p>
      It takes an average of 1000 years to decompose a plastic landfill, while a
      normal plastic bottle decomposes in 450-650 years.
