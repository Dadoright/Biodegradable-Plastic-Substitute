## Overview 

Plastic usage has been abused and adulterated by mankind,
stepping towards the highest risks of pollution.
The net increment of usage hasnâ€™t been calculated for the year 2020,
but undoubtedly an exponential rise can be predicted.
Disposal and the 3R method seems to be in the air,
but plastic landfill is the commonest problem well known,
but solutions are not yet properly addressed by any responsible authority.

Three 3rd year undergraduates from the University of Peradeniya have invented a 
100% Bio-Degradable Sanitizer bottle and Sanitary wipe package to combat this issue.
Navodya  Kumari Ekanayake, a third-year medical student;
Shakthi Senarathne, a third-year medical student;
Denuka Jayaweera, a third-year engineering undergraduate are working on this team CLOUD ATLAS.
 
The unseen negative environmental impact created by the expeditious use and irresponsible disposal of plastic hand sanitiser bottles, during the current COVID 19 pandemic has intrigued them to invent the new model.
Their aims are to make an impact on environmental conservation, to contribute towards United Nations Sustainable development goals 3,6,9,12, to give a sustainable alternative for sanitary needs in the market, to reduce the usage of polythene and plastics and to take a value out of banana stem which is thrown away after harvesting.
Due to the covid pandemic, the usage of sanitiser bottles increased drastically. If 5,000,000 [which is less than 25% of the population] people discard one sanitiser bottle each per 2 weeks, the number of sanitiser bottles discarded per month is approximately 10,000,000 bottles. If so the total amount of plastic landfill added by sanitiser bottles per month equals the total number of bottles discarded into the mean weight of one bottle which eventually add up to around 300,000 kg of plastics per month only by sanitiser bottles.
 
They figured out this directly affected the usage of polythene and plastic in Srilanka. And to add to that normal bottle of sanitiser takes about 450-600 years to get decomposed, other than that there was no such biodegradable product in the market similar to this not only in Sri Lanka but in the global context as well.
 
The prototyped product was the first bottle model and sanitary wipe in the world, to be made out of a banana stem as the main ingredient. All these products have a net 0% environmental impact. Which decomposes completely within one month. They chose banana paper over normal recycled paper, to gain a net 0% environmental impact. Even recycled paper demands an additional cost of cutting trees, which is harmful to the prevailing situation of the country. They have aimed at minimal deforestation and carbon footprint in the production process.
 
Recently, bamboo came as a substitute for normal trees in China and East Asian countries. But in countries like Sri Lanka, bamboo cannot be used as a substitute ingredient for paper, as we don't have considerable bamboo cultivation targeting production. Bamboo is highly resilient against soil erosion, especially in river beds. Banana has the same properties found in bamboo and is easily found in Sri Lanka. Add to that the fineness of a banana is better than bamboo ( with an average fineness of 2400Nm ). Worldwide there is a good market for bamboo wipes due to their softness. Therefore banana would be better
 
The team emerged as the ideation champions in Thinkwave 2.0 organized by the University of Moratuwa, Overall runners up in Thinkwave 2.0, champions of Pera Inventra 2021 and second runners up of YES Youth Entrepreneurship Summit organized by the University of Sri Jayawaradenapura.
