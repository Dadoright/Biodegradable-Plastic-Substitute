## Overview 

Plastic usage has been abused and adulterated by mankind,
stepping towards the highest risks of pollution.
The net increment of usage hasnâ€™t been calculated for the year 2020,
but undoubtedly an exponential rise can be predicted.
Disposal and the 3R method seems to be in the air,
but plastic landfill is the commonest problem well known,
but solutions are not yet properly addressed by any responsible authority.

Three 3rd year undergraduates from the University of Peradeniya have invented a 
100% Bio-Degradable Sanitizer bottle and Sanitary wipe package to combat this issue.
Navodya  Kumari Ekanayake, a third-year medical student;
Shakthi Senarathne, a third-year medical student;
Denuka Jayaweera, a third-year engineering undergraduate are working on this team CLOUD ATLAS.
